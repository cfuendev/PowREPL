<p align="center">The simple REPL for declarative calculations I've been missing</p>

This project is a simple REPL I built with the goal of recreating the experience that is using PowerShell as a calculator (Read-Eval-Print Loop + E/EXP/EEX/Calculator Scientific Notation) and pairing it with some custom operators.

### Changelog

- May 11, 2025: PowREPL v0.2.0: Flask/Jinja Frontend

  - May 4, 2025: PowREPL v0.2.1: Add syntax checks to avoid arbitrary code execution

- Feb 18, 2023: PowREPL v0.1.0, pretty unstable

  - Feb 19, 2023: PowREPL v0.1.1: Fix [Custom operators crashing the interpreter](#1)

### Roadmap

- [x] E/EXP/EEX/Calculator Scientific Notation

- [x] A %> B = A% of B

- [x] A %? B = What percent of B is A? | How much of A is part of the whole of B?

- [ ] A % B = A (mod B) | Remainder of A รท B

- [ ] Better Result Units

### Known Issues

None at the moment
